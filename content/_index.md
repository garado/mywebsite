# Hello!
I'm Alexis, a firmware engineer at [Supernal](https://supernal.aero) working on energy storage systems for electric aircraft. I like figuring out how things work, solving problems, and above all, learning as much as I can. Iâ€™m passionate about Linux (Arch btw), embedded systems, computer architecture, and robotics, and in my free time I'm probably playing guitar or out biking somewhere.
